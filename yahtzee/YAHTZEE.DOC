  SysOp Information:

       BBS Yahtzee Should Run on almost any BBS.. given the right data
       in the configuration file..

       The Following Files Should be in the same directory as Yahtzee.EXE :

                     Yahtzee.RNX   <---- if missing Yahtzee Will Create.
                     Yahtzee.CFG   <---- Modify this file for your BBS.
                     Yahtzee.DOC   <---- The file your reading now.
                     Yahtzee.EMU   <---- Ansi Protocol for Yahtzee.
                     Yahtzee.EXE   <---- Executable file.
                     Yahtzee.SCR   <---- Graphic screen for Yahtzee.
                       Setup.EXE   <---- Setup/Install utility program.



 Running BBS Yahtzee in Local mode :

     You may run BBS Yahtzee in the Local mode by typing the following
     at the DOS prompt

          C:>Yahtzee Your Name

   Note : if any parameters are passed to Yahtzee it will assume Local
          Mode and won't use the modem at all.

    Another way to run local from your BBS is use the Dorinfo1.def door
   file or another door file that indicates local by writing 'COM0' to the
   door file. When BBS DragRacing reads the door file it searches for 'COM0'.
   if it finds 'COM0', It will assume the local mode.



 Running BBS Yahtzee on your BBS :

       To run BBS Yahtzee on your BBS you will need to know what your
       BBS uses as a user file that is "DORINFO1.DEF", "CALLINFO.BBS"
       "USERFILE" etc..  If you don't Know What line numbers that your
       userfile uses for User's first names and Last names and Baud
       Rates, You'll need to look at them using a text editor and figure
       out which line has this information..

       If your userfile is not a text file, that is, a binary file or
       or something else then you might try using QKDOOR.EXE to convert
       your user file into a text type file.

       If your userfile has a Time left line and a Time Limit Line
       then BBS Yahtzee will use that information if you tell it
       where to find it..



 NEW:    BBS Yahtzee Now supports Systems that use Chain.Txt user file.
       for reading the amount of time a user has left..(in Seconds)
       check out the Yahtzee.Cfg file for more info.

       Use Setup.exe program that comes with BBS dragracing package.
       Simply plug in the appropriate information, set up your batch file
       or whatever it is that you do to run a door.. and your all set.

       If You have Registered BBS Yahtzee with the Author (me), It is very
       important to make sure that the upper and lower case letters are
       correct in your registration number.

       BBS Yahtzee will detect a Carrier Loss and return to the system.
       It will update the player's status in the player data file, So
       dropping  carrier won't undo any monetary losses etc...
