 To:

   Jim Connor,

     Thanks For Your Inquiry and Donation for BBSGolf.
   Be sure to keep checking for newer versions.  I plan to make a few more
   changes during the next year. If You wish to register any of the other
   doors that I have written, You may deduct $5.00 from each one that you
   would like to register.  So for you, Xeno-Quest, BackGammon, and Drag
   Racing, will only require $20 each..

    All future versions of BBS Golf as well as old versions will work in
   registered mode if you put the following information in the
   configuration setup.

   Upper and lower case is very important...

   Use Setup.exe and enter the following data EXACTLY as it is written
   below..
