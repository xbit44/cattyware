 Running XENO-QUEST in Local mode :

       You may run XENO-QUEST in the Local mode by typing the following
       at the DOS prompt:

          C:>XQ Your Name

       Any parameters are passed to XENO-Quest are assumed to be the player's
       name.

        There should be No Need to have an Ansi Driver Loaded.

   Note : if any parameters are passed to XENO-QUEST it will assume Local
          Mode and won't work on your BBS in remote mode.


 Running XENO-Quest on your BBS :

       To run XENO-Quest on your BBS you will need to know what your
       BBS uses as a user file that is "DORINFO1.DEF", "CALLINFO.BBS"
       "USERFILE" etc..  If you don't Know What line numbers that your
       userfile uses for User's first names and Last names and Baud
       Rates, You'll need to look at them using a text editor and figure
       out which line has this information..



                          USING THE SETUP PROGRAM

       Use the Setup.exe program to Modify the Configuration file for
       XENO-Quest. If Your BBS uses Chain.txt or Dorinfo1.def for Door
       files then the  Setup program has defaults which it will automatically
       enter for the line numbers of where to find the users data.  Just type in
       either Dorinfo1.def or chain.txt on the line labeled "USERFile Name".
       and SETUP will display the default line numbers.

       If your userfile is not a text file, that is, a binary file or
       or something else then you might try using QKDOOR.EXE to convert
       your user file into a text type file.

       If your userfile has a Time left line and a Time Limit Line
       then XENO-Quest will use that information if you tell it
       where to find it..

 NEW:    XENO-Quest Now supports Systems that use Chain.Txt user file.
       for reading the amount of time a user has left..(in Seconds).

       Simply plug in the appropriate information in the Setup Program,
       save the data,  set up your batch file or whatever it is that you
       do to run a door.. and your all set.

       XENO-Quest will run on a multi-node system provided that there are no
       other copies of XENO-Quest running in memory that use the same interrupts.
       It has been tested running on com1 and com2 simultaneously and on com3
       and com4 simultaneously.. however if you try to run on com1 and on com3
       at the same time, interrupt conflicts may occur if your multitasking
       software does not provide for shared interrupts.

       If You have Registered XENO-Quest with the Author (me), It is very
       important to make sure that the upper and lower case letters are
       correct in your registration number.

       XENO-Quest will detect a Carrier Loss and return to the system.
       It will update the players Status in the player data file.

       If you find that you need XENO-Quest to perform some specific
       tasks on exit, Let me know what it is and we'll make it do what
       you need it to.

       XENO-Quest can keep track of up to 100 players at a time, and
       requires no events to be run and NO Maintenence.
